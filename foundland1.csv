There's also [Coastal Outdoors](https://livelifeoutdoors.com/) on Topsail Road in Mount Pearl just before the overpass (they also have locations in Carbonear and Clarenville), but they don't specialize nearly as much as OP.

I've fished Long Pond myself, and there's plenty of trout there. I haven't fished Mundy Pond, but there are fish there as well. So much so that you sometimes see small hawks looking for their dinner there.

Rennies River and the Waterford River also have moderately healthy brown trout populations, and are easily accessible. I haven't fished the Waterford in a while, but I understand it has undergone some changes in recent years from storm and flooding activity that have damaged habitat, and the brown trout population isn't what it used to be. It is still fishable, though.

North of the city, around the Torbay-Bauline-Flatrock area, many of the ponds have rainbow trout, too.

For a bit more local knowledge, you might find it worthwhile to drop by [Blue Charm Angling](https://goo.gl/maps/qHEXXYdjAtp) on Waterford Bridge Road, or [OP Fishing &amp; Hunting](https://goo.gl/maps/Y8hzyfdb8tP2) on Sagona Avenue in Mount Pearl. OP would be my first stop, personally.

All relevant rules and regulations regarding species, season dates, equipment, bag limits, licensing, etc., can be found in the current year's Angler's Guide, which can be accessed or downloaded as a PDF on the DFO website at http://www.nfl.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/NL/AG/anglersguide

Avoid using corn for bait if anyone tells you it's good. It's illegal and a fish killer (wildlife tech and enforcement officer here haha) I use worms and if you catch a fish you can use a piece of belly or other meat from the trout if you run out. 

Avoid brook inlets, the ice is a lot weaker and sometimes not froze at all. I'd rather you not catch a fish in the middle of a pond than drown.
