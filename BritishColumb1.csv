A level wind is a mess of components that all cause some friction, even with the things well maintained, with light lubricants and set loosely on the bearings, it can be hard to let line out efficiently in deep water with light tackle.  Even a spinning rod, when you get down there, just the friction of line cutting into underlying wraps can hold it up because it is pulling the line off perpendicular to the wraps, especially as you get down into the bottom of the spool and the line hasn't been used very much and has tight turns in it.

A good mooching reel has the lightest friction and will play out the line dependably.

As for trolling, the simplicity of a well maintained mooching reel allows you to drop the downrigger ball without tending to the rod.  Just drop it in the holder, and send your cannonball flying.  The drag is consistent during static pulls or dynamic, so it plays out at the first drop without pulling your leader out of the quick release, and holds firmly enough to maintain appropriate tension while trolling, then has appropriate tension for setting or fighting, without needing adjustment.  That's hard to find even in a good spin caster or level wind, impossible for similarly priced ones.

With practice you can make anything work, I've even caught chinook and halibut with hand lines, but mooching reels just make things easier, in some ways.

For unskilled fishers, I like to set them up with a level wind or spin caster.  Unless they thumb the drum, they can't really over do it and part the line.

The first would be a trolling setup. For the fly rod you will want either a clear intermediate or full sink line, a few feet of leader (anything in the 8lb range of monofilament or fluorocarbon) and a trolling fly. Leeches are very popular but you can also use scuds (freshwater shrimp) and other options. For the gear rod you can just run your mainline to a small swivel and then a leader in the same specs as your fly rod. Use small spoons/spinners, like 1/16 or 1/8oz. To weight down your line look into getting some clip on weights from 1-4oz and you'll fish that with 50-100' of line out. You can also add a gang troll in front of the leader if you are wanting a bit more attraction. 

The next is a cast and retrieve setup. For the fly rod it's usually an intermediate line as above, similar leader, and flies. Fish these in the shallows up to the drop off. Experiment with retrieve patterns. On the spinning rod it's fairly similar to the trolling setup but you may want to ditch the swivel and tie the spoon/spinner directly to the mainline.

Finally, you have your bobber/indicator setup. For a fly rod this is floating line, with a length of leader that is as deep as where your are fishing (so anywhere from 10-20'). You'll want a small rubber bobber stop on this line to remember where you set your indicator depth at. Then a quick release indicator on your leader, then tie to a micro swivel and a small splitshot weight above the swivel to help your rig turn over. Then a 2' section of light tippet, I use 4lb fluorocarbon but I'm pretty confident in my ability to play fish so you can upsize to 6 or 8lb if you want. Then a fly such as a balanced leech or chironomid. The spinning rod is a similar setup but instead you'll want to have a slip bobber with two rubber bobber stops above your bobber, and a small plastic bead. I'd recommend a 5 gram bobber, anything bigger and fish tend to not commit to taking the lure. You'll have this on your mainline and then have a swivel at the end. Again, some weight above the swivel, you'll want around 5 grams to balance the bobber. Then a 2' section of tippet to whatever you want - a hook with a worm, some fake trout eggs (Patzkie fire eggs I think they are called), shrimp, etc. You can also use flies from your indicator fly setup as well.

Let me know if you have any questions. A tackle shop is also able to help you get setup with all this. Don't get a ton of tackle, you really only need a few lures like some rooster tail spinners and Gibbs Crocs.

If you're after bass, smallmouth in cultus. I caught a big tank out of there last year with a pink tag from when they initially started tagging them 6 years ago. Largemouth bass are everywhere connected to the fraser from chilliwack down and the sumas river system. They're also in mill lake in abby, willband, frog lake pond, Albert dyck lake, a few lakes you can't access along the border, and plenty more including deer lake in Vancouver. Same with carp. I caught a carp out of a back slough of the fraser near chilliwack. Most carp locations will be slow moving swampy rivers, creeks and sloughs.

Pumpkinseed are pretty much everywhere that has warm water. They're even in The hot springs at harrison. Any slough connected to the fraser downstream to richmond will have them, including the sumas river in abby. They are now also in cultus lake, their population seems to be low but they're there now too.

There is yellow perch now in the fraser valley. The only spot I know is devil's lake on the west side of the stave. The ones I've seen are not very big, but they'll breed in large numbers and choke out the trout population. 

One lake we can't fish but has very big largemouth bass is Cheam lake, near popkum towards hope. You can walk in on the floating bridge and stand there and watch, or throw a few nightcrawlers in. It's crazy how big the fish are in there, and for some reason they closed it to fishing to protect the area.

Bluegill are all over the place too. I find them harder to catch than pumpkinseed and crappie. Try hatzic, the sumas river around hougen park, and silvermere lake in mission to get bluegill.

If you want to know any spots for specific fish pm me, I'll give away 90% of the spots for invasives, especially if you plan on eating them. I haven't eaten a largemouth bass, but smallmouth are good to eat and so are crappie. If you want to know what fish are in the lake, use a tiny hook and foam bobber with a small piece of worm, cast it not 5 feet from shore. If there's catfish, pumpkinseed, bass, or bluegill",[],,0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve caught crappie in Whonnock lake, hatzic lake, and there is absolutely massive ones in willband pond in abbotsford. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re after bass, smallmouth in cultus. I caught a big tank out of there last year with a pink tag from when they initially started tagging them 6 years ago. Largemouth bass are everywhere connected to the fraser from chilliwack down and the sumas river system. They&amp;#39;re also in mill lake in abby, willband, frog lake pond, Albert dyck lake, a few lakes you can&amp;#39;t access along the border, and plenty more including deer lake in Vancouver. Same with carp. I caught a carp out of a back slough of the fraser near chilliwack. Most carp locations will be slow moving swampy rivers, creeks and sloughs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pumpkinseed are pretty much everywhere that has warm water. They&amp;#39;re even in The hot springs at harrison. Any slough connected to the fraser downstream to richmond will have them, including the sumas river in abby. They are now also in cultus lake, their population seems to be low but they&amp;#39;re there now too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is yellow perch now in the fraser valley. The only spot I know is devil&amp;#39;s lake on the west side of the stave. The ones I&amp;#39;ve seen are not very big, but they&amp;#39;ll breed in large numbers and choke out the trout population. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lake we can&amp;#39;t fish but has very big largemouth bass is Cheam lake, near popkum towards hope. You can walk in on the floating bridge and stand there and watch, or throw a few nightcrawlers in. It&amp;#39;s crazy how big the fish are in there, and for some reason they closed it to fishing to protect the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluegill are all over the place too. I find them harder to catch than pumpkinseed and crappie. Try hatzic, the sumas river around hougen park, and silvermere lake in mission to get bluegill.&lt;/p&gt;

Double or treble hooks having a common shank are not a single barbless hook even when the barbs are closed or filed off.""

&lt;p&gt;If it says &amp;quot;single barbless hook&amp;quot; (which I suspect) then, sadly that lure is illegal. A quick legal definition: &amp;quot;single barbless hook means a fish hook having one point, manufactured without barbs or on which the barbs have been bent completely closed or filed off. Double or treble hooks having a common shank are not a single barbless hook even when the barbs are closed or filed off.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it says one hook or lure per line means you can not run something like a sabiki rig (one line with several hooks) to catch bait for example.&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously the public didn't have the appetite to watch the massive unnatural pods (up to140 orca in one area) starve, so we need to intervene.

Keep in mind also, I am fishing the Cariboo so I am not familiar with the lakes you are fishing. 

First, I will address your set up and, acknowledging I don't know what tackle you have, try to keep it simple. Trout in BC can be very leader shy. A drop shot set up off a heavy main line will probably spook them away. But a simple solution, that would be fairly inexpensive to is add a three way swivel. Mainline to top of swivel, tie the weight about 12 to 18"" off of the bottom. Then take a piece of leader (light pound maxima ultragreen is a cost effective option but I will admit that fluorocarbon is better) tied about 18"" to the the hook, bait with shrimp, and enjoy. Though thos is not a common style in BC I know of one fisherman, a truck driver, who uses across the province and it is quite effective. 

Lake trout a different animal. I will attempt a very brief rundown of the Lake Trout Fishing that I do on two lakes about half hour apart; one with kokanee and one with out. 

On the lake with out kokanee I will bounce a large jig off the bottom. This is pretty common across canada and most often you will see it is most often a 4""ish white tube jig. However, I use paddle tail swim bait. They can sometimes be had for cheap in BC  because of limited bass fishing. White is good, but generally a light colour or white bottom and bright top work as well. I use a 1/4 or 3/8oz jig head deoending on water depth but since you said you said you have weights the three way rig I mentioned above can be very effective. With the colder water the fish do come up shallower but they won't just be anywhere. They will be jist off a point ot bluff, at the transition from weed bed, or the top/bottom of steep drop off. Just slowly bounce it off the bottom.

In lakes with kokanee it is trickier but also simpler. Find the kokanee you find the lake trout. By this, I don't mean find a huge a school of kokanee, I mean, find the depth the kokanee are swimming at. (Also, if your lake doesnt have kokanee it doesn't mean it doesnt have another species lake trout will chase up the water column) Then simply lower a larger spoon, buzz bombs, kast master,  type lure and start jigging. Now this will generally not produce as many fish as jigging on the bottom can (and by that I mean most days you catch nothing) when it works it will generally be some of the largest Lakers in the pond.

Between the mainland and Vancouver island is the Gulf islands. Each one is slightly different with varying degrees of interesting and strange. Lasquiti isn't hooked to the power grid for instance.

You won&amp;#39;t be able to harvest shellfish in the summer due to the red tide - have to do that in the middle of winter like right now - and the Dungeness will be a bit smaller than ideal as the commercial season opens July 1st, but i&amp;#39;m certain you and as many friends as you can wrangle can find some ocean adventures somewhere in there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the excuse to remember a wonderful part of growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

From what I can see, your setup will consist of a bobber followed by a pencil lead a few feet down from it. The pencil lead will be attached off a swivel with about 3-4 feet of leader line. Use a pink wool possibly with a float bead for bait.

Bobber height will depend on what your depth is where you’ve decided to fish. Trial and error, you’ll have to get a feel for it but your weight should be near the bottom but not touching it, and the weight should be just enough the keep the bobber upright.

I went for a walk under the Vedder Bridge about 2 weeks ago saw a few hundred Pink Salmon all chilling in this 1 spot. Look for areas of the river that have deep pockets of slow running water, preferable just before or after a long stretch of fast running water. The fish use these spots to rest in between making their way up river and gather in large numbers. Look for rocky bottoms with no sand, the sand gets in their gills so they like the rocks.

From what I’ve seen most people on the Vedder stick to spin casters and fly reels. I’ve got some Abu Garcia baitcaster reels I used for the Fraser and my rods are 11.5’ and heavy duty, overkill for the Vedder I think and not ideal but whatever you have will work just fine. 

I saw a young kid on the Fraser pull in a 30lb Spring Salmon about 10 years ago with the smallest and cheapest looking setup you could imagine. Everyone thought it was cute and the kid was casting a quarter of the distance of everyone else and you can imagine their surprise when he pulled in that beast.

&lt;p&gt;This is entirely dependant on the species you are fishing for or where you are fishing. Herring you are allowed to use sabiki rigs which can catch multiple fish at once. Fraser River tidal actually allows a bar rig style. The exact wording from &lt;a href=""https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/rec/illegal-illegales-eng.html""&gt;DFO&lt;/a&gt;is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is illegal to:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- use barbed hooks when fishing for salmon, cutthroat trout or steelhead in tidal waters, including in tidal portions of streams (such as the Fraser River and Skeena River)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- use more than one hook, an artificial lure or an artificial fly attached except in:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;the tidal waters of the Fraser River where 2 hooks, artificial lures or artificial flies attached to a bar rig are allowed&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;tidal waters if multiple hooks are used in combination to hold a single piece of bait or if fishing for herring, mackerel, northern anchovy, Pacific sand lance, Pacific sardine or squid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even if it's unlikely that you individually would catch a fish from a threatened population, the impact of every fish that those populations lose can be huge, and if everyone did it the impacts would be far worse.  Especially notable is that this is an off year for sockeye, so the numbers are going to be even slimmer.

&lt;p&gt;So if I had a floating fly line and used a purchased sink tip (instead of an integrated tip on a fly line head) then is it against the rules, right? It&amp;#39;s acting as a sinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also an artificial fly is defined as: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;artificial fly: a single-pointed hook that is dressed only with fur, feathers, hair, textiles, tinsel and/or wire, and to which no external weight or external attracting device is attached. Two or more hooks tied in tandem is not permitted. Where gear is restricted to artificial flies, floats and sinkers may be attached to the line. Where areas are restricted to “fly fish only” floats and sinkers may not be attached to the line or fly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the list of materials is complete, beads would be considered not part of an artificial fly and therefore against the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

There's some pretty good boat fishing in that area, as well.
The bigger lakes (Bridge and the like) have some pretty reasonable Lake Trout fishing - and just after ice-off, you won't even need downriggers to get to them.
Or take a run down to Kootney Lake for those outsize Gerrard strain rainbows and Bull trout.

The options are endless - but for me, it's hard to beat a small Cariboo lake in a kick-boat during a chironomid, mayfly or sedge hatch!

Edited to add: you can use fly rods with your downriggers, as well  - just get reels that have a functioning drag - a cassette system is best, so you can swap the spools out (one with a dry line, one with a full sink, one with an intermediate sink, one with fluorocarbon or mono for DR fishing).

In the lower mainland there are a few options to fish for them including Deer Lake, Pitt Addington Marsh, Hatzic Lake, and Cultus Lake (to name a few). Further out there are a number of great spots on Vancouver Island and in the Okanagan that have bass as well. Bass fishing is actually one of the best things to do in the summer months with our limited options for salmon fishing (unless you own a boat to saltwater fish) and how slow lakes can be for trout.

Your swimbaits, chatterbaits, spinerbaits, crankbbaits, jerkbaits may find some use outside of bass fishing for thinks like lake trout. Football jigs are actually becoming more popular alongside hair jigs for twitching in rivers for salmon and steelhead. Softplastics depends on what they are but worms can be thrown on a small 1/8 - 1/4oz jig head under a float and catch steelhead, and curly tails on jigs when twitched can catch a number of species. Of course your inline spinnners and spoons are classics for stillwater and river fishing for both trout and salmon.

General rule of thumb is if the water is moving (rivers, creeks, etc) you need to use one single barbless hook. Most lakes are ok with treble and barbed but you will for sure need to check the regulations to be sure.

As /u/lexiecalderaxo said, keep the baitcaster as it is good for both cast and retriving lures as well as drift fishing, you may just need to pick up a 9-10' drift rod to pair it with.

It seems bivalve are always closed due to biotoxin. I always assumed this was the whole red tide thing until I recently ate some delicious BC oysters at a restaurant. 

There can’t have been a red tide from Jan 2018 - Mar 2023? 

Is this just lack of updating on the BC fisheries app? 

Is it some other biotoxin?

Is it area specific?

What’s the deal? Any advice greatly appreciated.

I asked for help here recently trying to find a lodge and he recommended me a place up island Kagoagh Lodge,  book for next year,  surprisingly decent rates.   Not sure what they have for this year,  think some places close after Sept long.

I was looking up day charters in Port Renfrew / Tofino,  think 1200ish a day if memory serves.

Edit the vedder River near van is supposed to be good,  stand on shore casting kinda fishing,  assume guides for that,  again call local fishing supply stores or ask on that forum. 


Take care


Only thing learnt from travelling,  is don't skimp out if a bucket list or go for the less good option.    You might not be back so might as well make the most of it. 

Anyways,  ask killer of whales,  he had some great advice and was super nice and knows this subject a thousand times better than I do.

Yes. If it was closed you can't target them. DFO sets openings based on returns and other things, so they change year to year and even day to day (yay DFO Fishery Notices).

&gt; Chinook Salmon: How many can I keep daily?

Zero right now, will change in August, likely to 1 per day.

&gt; Coho. Catching hatchery coho salmon is allowed. The chart has zero for *wild* coho salmon but the restrictions section seems to contradict that.

They do not contradict. The restrictions refers to areas where wild coho retention is allowed, this verbiage is used on every area. This area, however, is only hatchery marked coho.

&gt; Sockeye. Catch and release only?

Yes, but you shouldn't target them unless there is an opening. They don't have great C&amp;R survival rates compared to Chinook, Coho, Pinks and Chum.

&gt; I feel like I need a PhD in fisheries science to understand that page. Is there a non-government site that breaks down the info in a simpler way?

It's really awful, especially compared to how easy the freshwater regulations are. I recommend the FishingBC app, it's a bit earlier to parse things. Or just go into the local tackle store and talk to the folks there.

Note that you still need to use a **single barbless hook** with no bait, you must have your salmon conservation stamp on a valid BC Freshwater Licence, and your limit cannot be combined with the tidal (ie catch two in the Vedder and 4 in the lower Fraser, you are only allowed to retain a maximum of 4 per day regardless of the waters fished).

Also a friendly reminder that Sockeye salmon are still coming through and that there is a zero retention on them. Please bring a net with you (seriously it's like $30 for a rubberized one at Canadian Tire) or ask a fellow angler to net for you and don't drag them up onto the shore/banks unless you are **100%** certain it is a fish you can retain. Keep our fisheries healthy, clean up after yourselves, and tight lines!

Most fish you can take home and eat, whatever lake you do go to, you can look up online to check if there are any special fishing regs for that lake, sometimes certain species are catch and release only and invasive species are always take as much as you can and get it out. As a novice its going to be part of your job to do the research and make sure you are well informed.

By basic license I assume you mean freshwater lakes and rivers? If so its pretty much any public place unless otherwise specified.

As for the harvesting of fish, as soon as you catch the fish, if its a keeper, you will want a sturdy piece of wood about the size of the handle of a bat or less. You want to lightly smack the hea dof the fish just behind the gill plate and eyes, usually on the spot on the top of the head where the scales tend to stop and the ""head"" of the fish begins. This is where the brain is and a good whack will render it unconscious, if your fish is flopping around its not unconscious and you need to hit it again. You dont need to go all out slugger style and smash the fishes skull in, just a good whack to knock it out.

Afterwards you want to take your knife and slit in behind the gills to severe the artery, if blood pours out pretty fast you got it.

Take your fish and put it in the water, gently working the body of the fish with your thumb on one side and fingers on the other like a tube of toothpast you are trying to gently squeeze out. This pushes the blood out of the body of the fish, allowing it to bleed out and die while unconscious and also gets it out of the meat for that tasty eating you'll be doing later.

This is the most humane way to kill a fish.

If you are fishing from shore you will want to look up spinner set ups for constant casting and reeling or bobber set ups. If you are in a boat look up set up for trolling. I assume you will likely be fishing trout. I would recommend for spinners a good rooster tail, panther martin, or classic spoon. For a bobber I like to use live leeches or worms, but some people like those little plastic ones with the tails, never can remember their names.

That should get you started, and never be sorry for asking questions. Asking questions is the best way to learn.

As for other anglers, I did actually see some people catching fish!  
Before I brought my rod out of my vehicle, I jogged up and down the trail on both sides to see where I should set up shop. When crossing the bridge one-way, I saw a man who caught a fish. When coming back across the bridge, there was - once again! - someone wrestling with a fish, except this time it snapped his line. He also didn't really look like he knew how to fight with a heavy fish, so he was kind of just letting it yank him around. These were both around 10-10:30 AM.

Later while fishing, I did see I think ONE other person's line catch a fish, but they were standing outside of my view, and it looked like when they pulled the fish in the air, it was flopping upside down - making it appear foul-hooked as well. They released that one back into the water.

If you’d like to catch salmon, the majority enter the river in the fall to spawn but you’re in luck because there are a couple options right now.  The Capilano river has a summer run of coho. Recommend fishing that one at first light as they see a lot of gear thrown at them.  Another option is the Vedder which has a summer run of Red Chinook.  The run is just starting now which should also hopefully coincide with the water level dropping a bit and becoming more fishable. I’m hoping to get out the Vedder myself next weekend.

Stocked trout fishing would be your safest option. There are many lakes like lafarge, Como lake, deer lake etc... If you have a kayak, best bet would be fishing for stocked trout. Or you can go trolling for Salmon at UBC. Trust me there are alot of fish in BC. But the problem is how to catch them. I caught around  10 Pink Salmon this year at Capilano alone and about 15 Coho at Capilano. So trust me there are fish.For trolling for Salmon you can start in about 2 weeks to be safe. For fishing for Salmon run, it would be better if you wait till September, or earliest is August. Trout fishing right now is perfect, I went trout fishing  s few days ago but didn't catch anything. But it could have been my technique because there were a lot of top water activity. Would have been better for fly fishing.(Top water) Forums like Fishinfwithrod.com gives alot of help in fishing in Vancouver. The creator of the website is a well-known YouTuber in BC fishing community and the channel is the same as the website. For saltwater,  You need a bigger boat then just a kayak to catch bigger fish like lyncod or halibut, you can try catching rock fish or sole fish witch I have caught plenty aswell and they are the types of fish to be near land and not open water. For saltwater, I would recommend just jigging for fish, probably the most simple way to saltwater fish and the way I have caught the most fish. For trout, throwing out spoons, spinners, floating rigs and bottom rigs works well. For River Salmon, here is when it gets tricky, there are part of the river fish don't bite, so you have to rely on a technique called flossing. Bigger species of salmon don't usually bite but smaller species like coho do. Throwing out spoons or jig heads with soft plastic works well too. But tackle for Salmon fishing is expensive. And you tend to lose tackle quite alot too. Cheapest would be fishing for lake trout. Summary: Cheap and easy: Trout, jigging for near shore saltwater fish, moderately hard and moderately expensive: River Salmon, most expensive type of fishing in BC would be for sturgeon.
