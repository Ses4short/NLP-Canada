So my dad worked in QC at various manufacturing places since I was a kid. And one of the things that he explained to me was how quality control testing actually works. We would all like to believe that the products we buy are all individually looked at through a department we all know as quality control. However the way quality control actually works in large-scale manufacturing is large batch sampling. So somebody from the QC department will come along and sample a manufacturing run of a product, in this instance a Rapala lure. 


  Let's say they are doing a batch run of 250,000. It would take a long time to look at all 250,000 of those lures. So the QC person will take a couple hundred of these from various points in the production run and those lures that have been selected will be the ones that will be run through the quality control part department. The ones selected are at even intervals from one another so the QC department can find flawed product within part of a run. Organization is key


  Now every place has different testing parameters and what they're looking for as acceptable quality. Let's say the first three lures they look at are perfect, but the next three have a huge defect on the painting. Well that won't be acceptable as a final product, so quality control would go and find that part of the batch run for those three sample lures, and the ones in between the first and third, pull that entire part of the batch and check it. it's a very effective way of checking for quality, but it isnt 100% foolproof.

You can find them at Bass pro shop or similar. They are good for bass,walleye etc. If you want to go after Pike, Salmon etc that are much heavier you'll want either a big water type spinning rod or a bait casting rod, I can't speak much to brand here as I bought my big water spinning rod used. That said Ugly Stik makes a great big water spinning rod as well that would be great for larger game species.

As for fishing there are charters on Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, There is also a guy who does charters in the Niagara River for salmon iirc.

If you want really really good fishing you'll have to travel. Last big trip for me was the old post lodge up on Lake St. Joseph (1000KM north of Thunder Bay) Which for me was a fly in, it is possible to drive but it would be probably a 20 hour trip each way.  There are some lodges on the french river about 3 hours from TO that aren't super expensive.

Enriched by ocean currents and tossed by tides, these cool nutrient-rich waters provide a “soup” that sustains whales, pinnipeds, fish and an astonishing array of marine birds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_3ounvl,,,,,,,,,,,1444913590,,0,,,,,,2015-10-15 08:53:10,,1446983815.0,,,,,

**Ontario Conservation Officers Association**

NEWS - Four Non resident anglers from Indiana were caught with 50 walleye in their possession. The limit for the anglers was 10 therefore possessing 40 more walleye than the permitted limit and were fined a total of $10, 000.

Each man was fined $2, 500 and forfeited all of their fishing equipment to the crown.

Court heard that Conservation Officers stopped two of the males in a boat on Nungesser Lake north of Red Lake, Ontario. The males stopped on the water possessed no walleye within the boat and advised they were practicing catch and release that day because they had their limit of walleye back at the lodge.

Upon inspecting the camp it was determined that there were 36 walleye in the refridgerator, some in plastic bags and some already cooked. 14 additional walleye were located in the freezer.

One male possessed a sportfishing non resident licence which only allowed him to possess 4 walleye while the other three males had a non resident conservation licence entitling them to only possess 2.

Ontario appreciates all of our anglers who travel here from all over the world. In order to sustain healthy populations of fish the OCOA continues to encourage anglers to review their limits within the fisheries management zone you wish to fish within. 

Thanks Ontario Conservation Officers for putting the extra effort in to catch persons abusing natural resources.

One of the keys to sustainability of a fishery is the management of how humans extract fish, how much fish can be extracted from a given body of water and other environmental pressures in order to retain healthy populations for development. This also is true for wildlife in any province or state across our borders. 

Please review the Ontario Sportfishing Regulation Summaries to ensure you are doing your part by following the Provincial Possession Limits which sustains our fisheries for the future",,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2k8hu0,,,False,,,,t1_cliwfxu,,,,1414187231,,0,,,,,,2014-10-24 17:47:11,,1426365801.0,,,,,

The Pike in the picture was caught on a 6"" one piece black and silver Rapala, but the skirted spinners do well there also. I'd say the top Pike lures are Vibrax #5 and 6 and Rapala Husky Jerks. Spring and fall is top time for Pike and Trout, walleye....all year long. 

They also give a free return trip to the largest fish caught in all three categories, Trout, Walleye and Pike as well as hold draws for free trips.

In on Saturday Morning and out on the following Friday morning was $1,750 per person, and that included the flights in and out, private cabin, all meals in the main lodge, boats and motor for the week and all gas. 

Guides or live bait caught from the lake are extra, guides are $150.00 per day and bait I don't recall but not enough to be considered significant. The meals are top of the line, prime rib, turkey, pork chops, etc....since we've been going I've yet to be served Kraft dinner or beefaroni. One day of the week they take all guests out to an island for a group shore lunch where the owners put together a huge spread of Walleye, beans, garlic bread and onion rings. It makes for great camaraderie doing shore lunch with almost all the staff and guests together. 

Possession limit in the area is four, and a slot size is in effect, you can only keep one over 18"".  You can eat walleye every day though if you want, the lodge is happy to provide you either a lunch for while you're out on the lake, or some lard, potatoes, beans and a frying pan. 

I've seen guests eat Walleye for breakfast, then at shore lunch every day during their stay. 

You drive to Nakina Ontario and board the plane, after that almost everything is included in the weekly fee. Almost everyone we've ever met up there that were on their first trip in, planned on coming back again as soon as possible. Also if for any reason the fish aren't cooperating there's always a lot of regulars who are happy to share some locations.

t5_2zrlu,,,,False,,,3,,,,FishingCanada,,,,,,cjoxoml,,,0,True,,,Donny_Brook,,,t3_2dcx9l,3,,,,,,"There's a lot of variables involved in how to fish it in the heat of summer, Depth and temperature play a huge part in how to fish it because if the water gets too hot the fish will drop down to deeper and cooler areas to be comfortable.

We fish a Brook Trout pond in Northern Ontario that even though it's spring fed and the temps can be reasonable for the trout year round, they'll still drop down to the middle of the pond where it's a little cooler in summer. 

If you fly fish at all try watching for fish rising when it's calm, if you see them taking flies of the surface you'll know they're fairly close to the top and either use a fly or small spoons like some of the smaller Cleos and similar looking ones. Smaller spinners also can work well for Brook trout, Panther Martins, Mepps etc...

(If you don't fly fish it might be a good time to expand your arsenal.)


Where I go when they're deep we tie on a Marabou Jig, tip it with worm, Leech or a small minnow and fish farther towards the centre of the pond where it's deeper. 

Straight live bait fishing under a float can be successful but it can also hook fish too deeply to safely remove the hooks and if this is a natural population killing too many can really affect their numbers. 

It takes a good long while to learn any new water body and you're going to have yo experiment quite a bit and at different times of the year but once you get the how and when figured out have a nice little Brook Trout spot can be a great fishing experience. 

Keep in mind also that unless you like a LOT of company while you fish, telling a lot of people where it is won'y end well. ;)

Good luck and I hope you get it figured.

Try contacting the lodge you'll be staying at and ask if they feel you'll have opportunities to pick up nightcrawlers enroute or check the towns you'll be passing through for bait shops listed, it's a lot easier to keep themn freash and alive the closer to the lodge you can get them.

Any time you go into a new lodge or area for first time a guide or guided trip is a smart option, it may be a little expensive but if this is considered a once in a lifetime trip it can be a make or break decision. 

A drift boat trip down a river for steelhead and Salmon is something I've always wanted to try, I'm not a great fly fisherman but can throw one around when needed. The thought of a fresh Steelhead right out of the Ocean sounds pretty thrilling.

The tackle needs for Pike and Walleye are different enough you may want to consider two completely different set ups,  a lighter one for the Walleye and something heavier for Pike.  

For Walleye I use 6lb test and generally that does me pretty good, but Pike can be much more aggressive, a lot bigger and overall one insane fish. A minimum of 14lb mono and even that would be contested by a lot of people. 

The Walleye take smaller lighter lures and tackle, my preference is 1/4oz jigs and yellow, white or chartreuse twister tails with a medium/light action rod and reel capable of holding 110yrds of mono. 

For the Pike rod/reel everything is just heavier, including lures. I like husky Jerks, Rapalas, Williams spoons etc....A mediium / heavy rod/ reel combo capable of throwing big offerings all day and moving a large fish that would rather not be moved. 

Go into your local tackle shop and explain your needs, they should be able to hook you up with two rod/reel combos for well within your budget, obviously it wont be the absolute to die for top of the line gear, but it will bring in fish.

Contact the lodge or prior guests and find out what works and where on the lake it worked if they'll share,  you should do fine and have a trip you'll remember for life. 

I'll look for a couple combos on Cabelas and post a link.

As for spooling a reel, I think youtube is your best bet, it's nice to be able to watch it being done before trying it. Keep in mind a lot of tackle shops have machines that will spool a line pretty promptly for you and make sure you're putting on the right line intended for that reel.
