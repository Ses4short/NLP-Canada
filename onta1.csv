As for timing, I think the charters usually target them through the whole summer as they run downriggers to get the bait down to their feeding zone.  

In the late summer the salmon will pool up at River mouths staging and preparing to run up river. Generally they stop feeding but you can catch them by throwing spoons, lots of people will fish them right through the night and into the early morning with glow in the dark lures. Ive never done it but from what I hear the salmon strike out of aggression and you usually have either a great night or bust. 

By September and through October they'll be running up the rivers and people usually fish them by drifting egg sacks along river pools/ runs. Depending on where you go, this can turn into shoulder to shoulder fishing (GTA rivers). 

I haven't fished for salmon before but if I was going to I would probably choose the late summer and cast off some piers late at night/ early morning.
